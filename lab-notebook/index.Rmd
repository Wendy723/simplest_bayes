# Welcome {-}

An extremely simple example of modeling and postprocessing a bayesian dataset with nonmem


## Technical Objectives

* How to build a bayesian control stream in nonmem
* how to set up chains
* how to postprocess results
* how to accept the posterior as a prior to a new model

## Learning Objectives

* demonstrate how the posterior distribution changes under certain characteristics
    * number of individuals
    * richness of data
    * strength of prior
* demonstrate how to provide iteratively updated recommendations
